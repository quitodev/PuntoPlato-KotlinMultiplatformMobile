PuntoPlato is an application that was born as a result of a solidarity initiative called "Servir un plato m√°s", which consists of offering food plates for the people who need it most. If you have the chance to cook an extra food, you can leave it at different points so that people can come and pick it up.

With the application I tried to show all these points called "Punto Plato" on a map and giving the information of each one (address, schedules, and more).

Today the initiative is still standing, but for different reasons unrelated to development, the application was completed but pending of publication.
